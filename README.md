## 🧠 About The Project

Modern API Football Page is a front-end football dashboard designed to replicate real-world sports platforms.

This project focuses on:

- Building interactive, data-driven UI components
- Handling multiple football data types (matches, goals, transfers, league tables)
- Implementing real UX patterns such as modals, tabs, loading states, and empty states
- Enhancing user interaction with hover effects, animations, search, and sorting

The project is API-ready and currently uses structured mock data to keep the focus on UI logic, performance, and user experience.
